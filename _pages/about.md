Hi! I am a senior at Boston University studying Statistics and Computer Science. Chiefly, I am interested in data analytics, statistical storytelling, and building robust and user-friendly data systems. I have experience working with data in Python, SQL, and R. Currently, I work as a teaching assistant for an introductory computer science course, where I teach foundational Python programming and problem-solving skills. I am looking for early career opportunities in data science, database management, and software engineering.
